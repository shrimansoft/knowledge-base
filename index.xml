Idea of separation is an illusion.
Time is an illusion. ( there is no time there is only Unfolding )
We are not an exception to this nature. We are an example.
The force of feeling and how we can avoid this by practicing Vespasian.
( not yet realized ) The world is dynamic. ( Becoming otherwise)
( not yet realized ) Why do we exist?</description></item><item><title>Circle of time</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/circle-of-time/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/circle-of-time/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Generalisation of reinforcement learning</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/generalisation-of-reinforcement-learning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/generalisation-of-reinforcement-learning/</guid><description>What do we mean my generalization?
By the Process and Reality &amp;ldquo;we are no exception to this nature we are example of it&amp;rdquo;. Taking this Idea we can say that everything is like us has some level of active participation in the nature and during this interaction these things are evolving too.
To make this some what abstract Idea that every thing are like us evolving. I like to generalise this Idea that there is an agent rather every thing is an agent.</description></item><item><title>Important ideas</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/important-ideas/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/important-ideas/</guid><description>Reinforcement Learning

When we fix the policy, the above process becomes automatic. It will just run and run.
Because of a lack of knowledge, we use probability in this. #randomness
The above interaction dynamics can be studied using the MDP. So here, the MDP comes into the picture.
The MDP is how the agent sees his interaction with the world.</description></item><item><title>Modularity</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/modularity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/modularity/</guid><description>Thought The complexity of the system increases when we go from atoms to Organism.
We can understand And Realise Some of the above structures of the system to predict what will going happen to the system. #sub-representation #randomness
That is good, but why is there modularity in nature itself?
what is the reason? why does one world want to control another world why why?
We can say something exists that&amp;rsquo;s why it exists.</description></item><item><title>randomness</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/randomness/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/randomness/</guid><description>Why do Turing machine with a coin is capable of something more? Why do Nature follow some law ( constraints) and why something are random ( free at least from the Ability of our thought)?
Randomness $\to$ Evolution $\to$ RL I was wondering from where this randomness comes. If we understand from where this randomness comes, we will know the source of the origin of Evolution. We will get the origin of learning in RL.</description></item><item><title>Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/reinforcement-learning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/reinforcement-learning/</guid><description>Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, is a type of machine learning that involves an agent learning from its environment through trial and error. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments for its actions, and over time, it learns to choose actions that maximize its reward. Supervised Learning: Learning with labels defined by human Unsupervised Learning: finding patterns in data. Reinforcement Learning: This is a $4^{rd}$ machine learning paradigm, in which agent tries to maximise its reward signal.</description></item><item><title>Unfolding</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/unfolding/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/unfolding/</guid><description>The word unfolding doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the usual meaning in this context. Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s the generalisation using the whitehead&amp;rsquo;s flight analogy.
First, we have to collect some examples before we take off from the imaginative generalisation.
Example 1 Seed $\to$ organism.
Example 2 IMAGINATION OF An art $\to$ REALIZATION OF IT as painting.
Example 3 plan $\to$ Execution.
The example above will make the unfolding more apparent.
It&amp;rsquo;s like something was folded before, and now it&amp;rsquo;s unfolding.</description></item><item><title>Idea of separation</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/idea-of-separation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/idea-of-separation/</guid><description>There are two challenges we have with Triangular MDP. One is how it works if it is already there, and the other is how it can come into being from thin air.
I will try to answer the first one on the page of Triangular MDP, but to address the second question, we need to look at how humans get the idea of separation.
Triangular MDP is the simple realization of separation through RL.</description></item><item><title>Jul 21st, 2023</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/jul-21st-2023/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/jul-21st-2023/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
