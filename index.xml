Question: How will it do this? Answer: I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but this blog gives some insight on this question.
Now we will generalise the idea of using sin(x) in NN {assume that it&amp;rsquo;s possible. We will test whether it is possible with some experiments.}. We can use $e^x$, log(x), and some pertained NN. { this is unusual when you think about that if we replace one of the perceptrons from sin(x).</description></item><item><title>Diverse perceptron Neural Network</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/diverse-perceptron-neural-network/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/diverse-perceptron-neural-network/</guid><description>We use linear and nonlinear functions in the Neural network that will lead us to a beautiful structure that we call Universal approximation.
But what if, We want to tune a NN to work as $sin(x)$, we need more perceptions compared to replacing one of the perceptions (linear sigmoid) from some sin(x) like perceptron.
The network must propagate the signal from this signal to a single sin(x) perception to get an approximation of sin(x).</description></item><item><title>localisation of causation is the root of separation</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/localisation-of-causation-is-the-root-of-separation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/localisation-of-causation-is-the-root-of-separation/</guid><description>What I experience is that the thing we see separately is only based on the fact that stuff near can affect each other, and things that are fare away can&amp;rsquo;t affect each other.

How can a spider&amp;rsquo;s leg work when it has three joints and only two possible actions, namely, open and close? The accumulation of some fluid in his joints will decide the ratio at which his legs should open or close. and who will decide how much of fluid should be accumulated?
