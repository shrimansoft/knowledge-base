The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments for its actions, and over time, it learns to choose actions that maximize its reward. Supervised Learning: Learning with labels defined by human Unsupervised Learning: finding patterns in data. Reinforcement Learning: This is a $4^{rd}$ machine learning paradigm, in which agent tries to maximise its reward signal.</description></item><item><title>Jul 21st, 2023</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/jul-21st-2023/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/jul-21st-2023/</guid><description>I manage to setup Logseq in the Nix OS with the Xmonade desktop interface.
this will not check on all the lines but at least the line in which I am writing and I think that is more thing good to have this feature activated while I am writing.
this is not just fiction time I am an expert in this type of tool in my tool chain.
