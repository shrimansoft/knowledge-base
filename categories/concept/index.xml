Def: Something that process information, I will have input, output and Processing unit. Although in the book they assumed the triadic structure of IPS. While in my writing I don&amp;rsquo;t always assume that.
While I am working on the equality between action (output) and observation (input), sticking on the triad structure of IPS can lead to Inadequate results.</description></item><item><title>Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/reinforcement-learning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/reinforcement-learning/</guid><description>Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that involves an agent learning from its environment through trial and error. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments for its actions, and over time, it learns to choose actions that maximise its reward. Basic Implementation of Reinforcement Learning

Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s the generalisation using the whitehead&amp;rsquo;s flight analogy.
First, we have to collect some examples before we take off from the imaginative generalisation.
Example 1 Seed $\to$ organism.
Example 2 IMAGINATION OF An art $\to$ REALIZATION OF IT as painting.
Example 3 plan $\to$ Execution.
The example above will make the unfolding more apparent.
It&amp;rsquo;s like something was folded before, and now it&amp;rsquo;s unfolding.</description></item><item><title>Evolvebility</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/evolvebility/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/evolvebility/</guid><description>Evolvebility is the ability of an organism to evolve. 1
