Material Cause: The matter that makes up an object, like the chemical composition of an apple. Formal Cause: The unique form or structure that defines the object&amp;rsquo;s identity. Efficient Cause: The process or event that brings an object into existence, such as the growth of the apple tree. Final Cause: The ultimate purpose or potential of an object, like the apple&amp;rsquo;s potential to grow into an apple tree. ðŸŒ± Potency and Actuality: Objects have potency (potential) and actuality (realized potential).</description></item><item><title>cling to</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/cling-to/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/cling-to/</guid><description>[[Aug 4th, 2023]]
The following is one of the realisations I had during my first meditation retail 1.
We don&amp;rsquo;t cling to people or places. We can cling to the experience we have with them.
ooh, but the experience is dynamic in nature. So, How can you cling to it?
Ooh, it means you cling to the memory of those experiences and the effort and force we apply to recreate those experiences is useless and not going to work.</description></item><item><title>One direction Communication</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/one-direction-communication/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/one-direction-communication/</guid><description>File storage : [[communication]] from past to future. #Memory
In [[Space]]: we can do both direction [[communication]] .
But in [[Time]] we can only do one direction [[communication]].
I was listening to an audiobook (1984 by George Orwell). In that book, The character wanted to write a letter. but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have anyone to send this letter,
To whom I am going to write this latter to My Future.
but he wondered how could he communicate with his future.</description></item><item><title>Spiders leg</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/spiders-leg/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/spiders-leg/</guid><description>{{renderer excalidraw, excalidraw-2023-08-01-14-27-47}}
How can a spider&amp;rsquo;s leg work when it has three joints and only two possible actions, namely, open and close? The accumulation of some fluid in his joints will decide the ratio at which his legs should open or close. and who will decide how much of fluid should be accumulated? This will lead us to [[localised Intelligence]]. #Intelligence #emergence #Modularity
It is when a very abstract thing moves.</description></item><item><title>Transfer flexibility</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/transfer-flexibility/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/transfer-flexibility/</guid><description>Adapting to novel environments is transfer flexibility.
A long-standing, open question in biology is how populations are capable of rapidly adapting to novel environments, a trait called evolvability 1
