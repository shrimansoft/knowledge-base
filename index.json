So that everything may be one.\nThere is no separation at all\nFUCK\nwhere is this going? Is this entire game just the fuck of mind to make us exist and fuck.\nThis thought may not take us anywhere; it will just give us the chance to fuck. But there is no fundamental truth to explore at all\nModularity forced by the User. I read some papers on modularity. Then I realised the following things: cite:: cluneEvolutionaryOriginsModularity2013\nWe divide a complex system into small modules to understand it better.\nThere is no reason why a complex system to be modular on its own. We usually make it modular so that we can understand it better.\nEmergence of simplicity. todo:: hello\nWhen a learning system uses other learning systems to solve some task, if the second learning system is too complicated for the first one to understand, Then the first one will not use it. But if a second learning system is easy to understand, the first one will use it. #World view\nIn other words, we can see that the higher level of learning system forces the lower levels of learning systems to be modular in a hierarchical system. (Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s possible on a non-hierarchical learning system structure).\nRelation of modularity from continuty An agent can have a modular solution if the task is modular.\nWe represent the task through the reward function.\nIt means we can break the reward function into a sub-reward function.\nSpliting a function and modularity. Let us have a function.\n$$ f : \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow R^m $$\nwe can write it as $$ f_i : R^n \\rightarrow R \\textbf{ where } i \\in {1,..,m} $$\nIf you are trying to tarin a function approximator to clone the function $f$. There are two possible causes: Case1: $\\forall i$, $f_i$ is independent, then whether we train this function independently or together doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. Case2: if the parameters depend on each other, we have to train them together to get more efficiency.\n+ There is a picture, and a good explanation of this is given in a photo. Add the photo here Experimental verification of the above hypothesis: generate the data from a well-defined function $F:\\mathbb{R}^m \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^n$. Then we train a neural network to mimic it. Yes, we can do that, but we will first train it to predict the $F_i$ individually and computer it by teaching the hole function.\nWe will make some modular structures in the $F$ and see the above comparation.\nWhat is that modular structure\nModularity and evolvability “A major contributor to evolvability is the fact that many biological entities are modular” 1\n“Modularly varying goals seem to push populations away from local fitness maxima and guide them toward evolvable and modular solutions.”1\nReferences:\nJ.
