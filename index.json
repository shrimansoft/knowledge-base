[{"content":"Diverse perceptron Neural Network\nQuestion: How will it do this? Answer: I don\u0026rsquo;t know, but this blog gives some insight on this question.\nNow we will generalise the idea of using sin(x) in NN {assume that it\u0026rsquo;s possible. We will test whether it is possible with some experiments.}. We can use $e^x$, log(x), and some pertained NN. { this is unusual when you think about that if we replace one of the perceptrons from sin(x).}\nBut the problem here is how can we just put some function inside a neural network.\nNext, I will deal with this problem by assuming these functions as tools that the neural network learns to use. These functions say tools are not inside the neural network (Agent). It\u0026rsquo;s just a tool that The Agent use. This will lead us to think about the duality of things that belong to Agents or the World.\nI am going to handle the problem using reinforcement learning. Let us state an equivalent problem. The problem is the following. Let us assume we have a machine M that takes the state of chess and return the best next move. Make a world W in which we have this machine $M$ and chessboard C. We have to make an agent that has to learn how to play chess in this world W. This problem is different from than regular chess playing problem because here the optimum strategy is not \u0026ldquo;learn to play chess\u0026rdquo; instead \u0026ldquo;learn to use the machine $M$.”\n","permalink":"https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/diverse-perceptron-nerual-network-from-tools-in-rl./","summary":"Diverse perceptron Neural Network\nQuestion: How will it do this?

The wind is taking action on me, and I’m observing it.\nBut this pillar is taking action with some lights. But you know, what is action? When I start with some force. And what is observation?

I send him a letter and he sends a letter back. So, in the space, there is a possibility of both direction communication. But, in the dimension of time, there is only the possibility of one direction of communication.\nThis is an interesting fact that I just realized. It makes a difference between space and time in the way we can transmit information.\nAlong the same line of thought, there is another fact about the communication. In space, we transmit information using satellites, wires, and fibre optics. But how do we transmit information in time?\nStorage devices. Storming is the method of transmitting the information to the future. rather than the information just dying right now. This is how we transfer something to the future. #accumulation\nSo, everything has the nature of transmitting information. since, I was wondering where I can get space and time into the structure I am building using reinforcement learning, agent, perception, consciousness, action-observation, and what is the thing between action and observation.
