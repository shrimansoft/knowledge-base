For example, there is a field of vision where you can see some things and can‚Äôt see others. Sounds exist, but you can‚Äôt see them. The field of eyesight includes all the things that you can see. Things that you can hear don‚Äôt necessarily mean you can see them.\nThere might be a field where thoughts can appear. The most fundamental thing is what we can experience - the entire field of experience, the entire field of awareness. We can feel sadness, happiness, joy, irritation. We can feel touch, smell, taste, sight. These are all fundamental sensations.\nThe Process of Experiencing The second question is about the process of experiencing. What is the thing which is experiencing? How is the process of experiencing happening? What is the core of all experience? Is it a mixture of multiple pieces? Can we create something outside of us which can experience like this?\nThe Problem of Other Minds This leads to the problem of other minds. Even if we are able to create something which might be able to experience as we do, how can we measure or test that the entity in front of us is having a similar experience or awareness? How can we prove that other minds exist?\nA philosopher at IIT Bhubaneswar suggested that if you delve deep into this question, you might conclude that there is only one mind that exists - your own. But this is just one of the possible possibilities that we can entertain.\nImplications for Artificial Intelligence The problem of other minds is also important for the field of artificial intelligence. How will we know if the AI system we build is experiencing something? How will we know it is having conscious awareness? When will we be able to tell them they are conscious or give them individuality? When will we be able to treat them with respect? How much exactly do we have to do to achieve that? These are questions to think about.\n","permalink":"https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/the-problem-of-other-mind/","summary":"The Space of All Possible Experiences In process philosophy, many philosophers believe that the only truth we know is our experience - what we can feel, what can appear in our awareness, our consciousness.

Maybe I predicted that I would leave the place or do something, and I achieved that future through my action. But what if I predicted something over which I don‚Äôt have control? For instance, I predicted that a bud would become a flower. I don‚Äôt have control over that. It becomes a flower on its own. So, can I say it‚Äôs my action?\nMyopic look says, its not your action. but contrary it is also your action because you took the action of not cutting the flower, not killing the bird. You predicted that it would become flowers. In that sense, not harming the bird is an action that you took.

It‚Äôs just the perspective that‚Äôs different.\nAction and Observation are the Same When I take action, everything is a world. You are another world. I am a world. This is a world. Action is like I take action on another world. Everything is a world. So someone takes action, it‚Äôs taking action on someone else. I take action, the other one will observe it. If I take action and when that person observes something, that person takes actions on me, I will observe something. If the wind will not hit me, I will not feel it. The wind is taking action on me, and I‚Äôm observing it.\nBut this pillar is taking action with some lights. But you know, what is action? When I start with some force. And what is observation?

I can\u0026rsquo;t cross a wall but I can come close to it.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t kiss you but I can come close to you so that you can kiss me.\nProof of Randomness I just had a conversation with Dogara sir. In the last movement, we talked about randomness and do probably exists. but now I get the idea. Does probability exist or does randomness exist?\nbut before answering this let\u0026rsquo;s ask what is ranmoness?\nrandomness is an experience that an agent feels and why does the agent feel this randomness? because of the lack of knowledge. i.e. something you feel is random because you are not able to predict what will happen about that thing. So the randomness is the reflection of the lack of predictability.\nAlright,\nNow what do we mean by predictability and how do we predict something? Predictability boils down to simulation or copying i.e. if you want to predict a system. what you do you make a representation of in your mind. and try to run the model ( which is a representation of the original system.) that is in your mind faster than the original system itself. if you can achieve that it means that you can what will happen to that system because what you did is first you copied that system in your mind and ran that faster the the original system.\nOkay, now we are going to enter the world of Turing machines. i.e. in the world of recursive algorithms. suppose there is a very powerful computer and the ability of the computation is near close to the physical limit. you can\u0026rsquo;t compute anything faster than that. these computers are extremely fast and you can\u0026rsquo;t do anything better than that (anyway this is an assumption but a sensible one.)\nin that universe, some program is running and there is another program. lets name the first program $A$ and the second program $E$. where $A$ is representing the agent and $E$ is representing the enviroment.\nhere the program $A$ is trying to predict the behaviour of program $E$. alos remember that both of them are running on the same computer of say same computation speed.\nbut they are independent i.e. they are not using the same processing unit but $A$ can physically observe $E$.\nWhat program $A$ can do? what best it can do? it copies the entire algorithm of the program $E$ and runs it on its side. since we are already using the best physically possible computation power. we can do anything better than this.\nso if the program $A$ has the algorithm of program $E$. $A$ can\u0026rsquo;t run it faster the the original program. and if it can\u0026rsquo;t run it faster than the original program there is no meaning or predictability.\nso will alternative the program $A$ can do is make a simple representation of program $E$ ( need to work on how this representation will work. ) but suppose he gets some simple representation of the program $E$ then $A$ can run is representation faster then the program $E$ can predict some partial aspect of the $E$.\nBut since he is not working with the exact algorithm of $E$ intended he is working with is simple representation which is easy to compute. that will lead to the experience of randomness when program $A$ will deal with the program $E$.\nsub-representation Randomeness and Priditablity You are interested in the relationship between randomness and predictability in nature. You assume that there is some fundamental limit to how fast something can evolve, process, compute, or transmit information in nature. You also assume that the only way to predict something accurately is to make an exact simulation of it and run it faster than the original system. However, since this is impossible due to the fundamental limit, you suggest that the workaround is to make a simplified model of the original system with lower computational cost, so that you can run it faster than the original system. However, this also means that you cannot capture all the details and complexities of the original system, and therefore there will always be some randomness or uncertainty in your prediction, because your model is only an approximation of the original system.

Makarov that discusses how to measure the degree of determinability of a system using correlation coefficients between observed and modeled processes.\nRandomness versus Determinism: Myths and Misconceptions, a paper by N. Gisin that argues that quantum physics shows that nature is fundamentally random and not deterministic, and that this does not contradict causality or free will.\nPredictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly‚Äôs Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?, a paper by E. N. Lorenz that explores the concept of sensitive dependence on initial conditions, also known as the butterfly effect, which implies that small uncertainties in the initial state of a system can lead to large differences in its future behavior.\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 14/09/2023 (1) Randomness and Predictability in Dynamic Chaos | SpringerLink. https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-74366-5_4.

Maybe the idea of separation we are doing is not right in the first place. Perhaps the thing we are thinking are separate are not really separate.

I will be working under it becouse I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything more than this (\u0026ldquo;scientific method of investigation\u0026rdquo;).\nge\nRemark One more way to see this idea of separation is when a world realizes another world for achieving some control over it. By the constraints of randomness, we achieve sub-representation.
