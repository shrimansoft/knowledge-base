This is a type of recurrent neural network. Where each perseptron are connected to other perseptrons.

This Hopfield Network also introduced a new theory of [Memory]({{< ref "/pages/Memory" >}}). [^1]

This is also connected to the problem of 3x3 connected node game. where I was treing to find the [[Modularity]] .

In this since the weight of the connection creats a gravity(force) on the state to get converge to a stable state which we call memory.  That perticual thing answars may question.

  + [[Error correction code and modularity]] in this we have subspace that maps to the same value. where here we have a sub space which will converge to the same memory. [^1]

  + We can see Hopfield generates modulary but it has some flavor of [[Force]]. [^1]
