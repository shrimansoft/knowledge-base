### Time, Action and Observation.

# Future, Action, and Observation

#[action = observation]({{< ref "/pages/action = observation" >}})

  + ## Future and Action

The future, filled with hope, dreams, expectations, and predictions, comes to the present through action. There’s a catch though. Suppose there’s something I predicted, like what I will do next. Maybe I predicted that I would leave the place or do something, and I achieved that future through my action.

But what if I predicted something over which I don’t have control? For instance, I predicted that a bird would become a flower. I don’t have control over that. It becomes a flower on its own. So, can I say it’s my action? But it is also your action because you took the action of not cutting the flower, not killing the bird. You predicted that it would become flowers. In that sense, not harming the bird is an action that you took. It’s your choice.

  + ## Freewill

There’s a problem though. There’s nothing called freewill. You are doing what you are supposed to do. I’m excited to write this because I’m looking for a precise answer.

  + ## Action and Observation

What is action and observation? There’s a future, there’s a past. The future comes to the present through action, and the present goes to the past through observation. What you observe will be in your past. What you haven’t observed is not in your pure past. Something you haven’t observed, what happened that day next to your room, you don’t know. That is not in your past.

  + ## Reinforcement Learning and World Structure

Right now, this thing about action and observation is very interesting. I was doing this reinforcement learning thing, and then I came to this world structure. When I’m dealing with the world, I realize that action and observation are the same thing. It’s just the perspective that’s different.

  + ## Action and Observation are the Same

When I take action, everything is a world. You are another world. I am a world. This is a world. Action is like I take action on another world. Everything is a world. So someone takes action, it’s taking action on someone else. I take action, the other one will observe it. If I take action and when that person observes something, that person takes actions on me, I will observe something. If the wind will not hit me, I will not feel it. The wind is taking action on me, and I’m observing it.

But this pillar is taking action with some lights. But you know, what is action? When I start with some force. And what is observation? When I observe, I get some energy inside. Muscular. And if Lee knows converse, I think I practiced at the time.
