**File storage** : [communication]({{< ref "/pages/communication" >}}) from past to future. #Memory



In Space: we can do both direction [communication]({{< ref "/pages/communication" >}}) .

But in Time we can only do one direction [communication]({{< ref "/pages/communication" >}}).



I was listening to an audiobook (1984 by George Orwell). In that book, The character wanted to write a letter. but he doesn't have anyone to send this letter, 

To whom I am going to write this latter. My Future.

but he wondered how could he communicate with his future. 

> I can only say something to my future and listen to my past.

So, there is communication but only in one direction. 

But, if you look at the space, I live here and one of my friends lives in another town. I send him a letter and he sends a letter back. So, in the space, there is a possibility of both direction communication. But, in the dimension of time, there is only the possibility of one direction of communication. 

This is an interesting fact that I just realized. It makes a difference between space and time in the way we can transmit information. 

Along the same line of thought, there is another fact about the communication. In space, we transmit information using satellites, wires, and fibre optics.  But how do we transmit information in time? 

**Storage devices**. Storming is the method of transmitting the information to the future. rather than the information just dying right now. This is how we transfer something to the future. #accumulation

So, everything has the nature of transmitting information. since, I was wondering where I can get space and time into the structure I am building using reinforcement learning, agent, perception, consciousness, action-observation, and what is the thing between action and observation. Maybe nothing maybe the information processing system. So what is this information processing system, You and me? There are lot of questions in my mind and I am just writing them down. 

Hoping, hoping, hoping..... that my mind will bloom by itself. It means I don't do any thing No there is something I need to do. Okay, so what do I need to do? I need to make my mind actively present on the situation, and environment and be wondering.  wondering about the thought. wondering about things. 

Alright, I am hoping that just by putting my mind on the genuine problem. will make my mind flourish with the answers I was hoping to get. But I am not the first one who is going to be dealing with this. 

How hard will this path be? I don't know. What is hard? What is suffering? In this search, these terms are lost. But alright. 

but before I go. one last thing to whom I am writing this. I am writing this to my future. There is no way I can know what my future will be thinking. There is no way to know how are you-me. 

Most of the time I read from my past and write to my future. I just listen to my past speak to my future and wonder in the present. #Time #communication #information #action
