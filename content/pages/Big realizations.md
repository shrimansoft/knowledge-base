## These are the list of  big realisations I have experienced.

  + [Idea of separation]({{< ref "/pages/Idea of separation" >}}) is an illusion.

  + Time is an illusion. ( there is no time there is only [Unfolding]({{< ref "/pages/Unfolding" >}}) )

  + We are not an exception to this nature. We are an example.

  + The force of feeling and how we can avoid this by practicing Vespasian.

  + ( not yet realized ) The world is dynamic. ( Becoming otherwise)

  + ( not yet realized )  Why do we exist? Who am I? From where are all these things coming into existence? Why does this something exist? Why do I exist?

  + [Circle of time]({{< ref "/pages/Circle of time" >}})

  + I don't know how to name it yet

    + But this idea is that we have some freedom to act and some constraints. Similarly, I think everything in this universe is like that.
