This is a phenomenon in which **Small Identical Things** come together and **perform in symphony**. which show some behaviours that we call **emergence**.
> Wondering: Why emphasize Identical things? does it have some relation with Plato's cook's mould?

### [Emergence]({{< ref "/pages/Emergence" >}}) and Consciousness are connected.


### [Emergence]({{< ref "/pages/Emergence" >}}) and Consciousness are connected.

  + These are some reasons why I think [Emergence]({{< ref "/pages/Emergence" >}}) and Consciousness are connected.

    + They both need Multiple Identical things.


    + They both need Multiple Identical things.

      + To get what this means see read the page of consciousness. Where you see how from RL -> Consciousness.

    + They **both are very mystery**.


      + some thing are coming which we don't know from where this is coming from. In case of emergence we get some thing more than we have. In case of consciousness, it just come for thing air.

    + We can say that Consciousness is it self and emergent phenomenon.

### Emergence is laws/symmetry arising from Complexit at different scales.


  + yesterday I was talking to Nishant about the difference between emergence and reducsanisam. during that conversation, we are taking the example of statistical mechanics. 

how do statistical mechanics drive the thermodynamical laws from the more fundamental laws (Newton's mechanics.)

In the above example, we have two scales view of the phenomena. One is at the level of thermodynamics and the other at the lavel of molecular dynamics.  and at the each scale, there is some pattern but not in between. 

so these laws/symmetry/conservation are coming from for what we called emergance. we can invstigate this what I am sysing by this question. 

Does there exist an emergent phenomena which dosen't show any of symmetry? 

that is something we call chaos. Becouse it's very hard for our mind to make sence of what is going on.
