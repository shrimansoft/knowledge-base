Before I talk about the Triangular MDP, let me first discuss the idea of separation.
Why am I talking about this? Because there are two challenges we have with Triangular MDP. One is how it works if it is already there, and the other is how it can come into being from thin air. 

I will try to answer the first one on the page of Triangular MDP, but to address the second question, we need to look at how humans get the idea of separation.

What I experience is that the thing we see separately is only based on the fact that stuff near can affect each other, and things that are fare away can't affect each other. The localization of causation is the root of our idea of separation.
We say I am acting on $A$ and not in $B$ because they are separated by space or time. Say I acted on this today, and I acted on that tomorrow. Somehow all these things I think are head to answer are coming and connecting each other and I don't know form where should I start.

I remember in a conversation with [Ashoke Sen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoke_Sen)., I told him that in quantum entanglement, things are connected through distance, which looks counterintutu when we look at it through the lens of the separation-based spatial("related to space"). may be the idea of separation we are doing is not right on the first place. Maybe the thing we are thinking is not separate. We can say that because we have to deal with the uncertainty of the system. We don't know how it's coming into the picture.
With this, we opened the initial new page of mystery that physicists have been working on for a long time: the "Who do entanglement works".
Science is not everything, but this is what we have right now. How much do I say I am not a scientist anymore? I will be working under it becouse I don't have anything more than this ("scientific method of investigation").

#### Remark
One more way to see this idea of separation is when a world realizes another world for achieving some control over it. By the constraints of randomness, we achieve sub-representation. During these subrepresations, the set of things mapped to one thing are called "things," which is the source of separation.
