The following is one of the realisations I had during my first meditation retail [^1].



We don't cling to people or places. We can cling to the experience we have with them.

ooh, but the experience is dynamic in nature. So, How can you cling to it?

Ooh, it means you cling to the **memory of those experiences** and the effort and force we apply to recreate those experiences is useless and not going to work.

Our lack of wisdom makes us do so.

And the frustration of not getting any result makes us miserable.

Miserable with **new people**, miserable with the **present**.

So, accept the simplicity and leave. Right now, it will take time to practice and work on it.



Take a deep breath, look around, and look "who is looking".

Test your tongue, smell your nose, see your eyes.

Come to now and become Love.
