Aug 4th, 2023 you don't cling to person or places. you cling to the experience you have with them.

and since the experience is dynamic in nature how can you cling to it.

so, you cling to the memory of those experience and the effort and force we appy to recreate those experience is worth less and not going to work.

our lack of wisdom make us do so.

and the frustatoin of not geting any result make us misarable.

misrable with new peoples misrable with present.

so, accept the simplicity and leave Right Now it will take time practice and work Do it Do it.......
