Markov decision process is a mathematical model.

The above interaction dynamics can be studied using the MDP. So here, the MDP comes into the picture.



Remark: Because of a **lack of knowledge**, we use probability in this. #Randomness

Remark: When we fix the **policy**, the above process becomes automatic. It will just run and run.
