How can a spider's leg work when it has three joints and only two possible actions, namely, open and close? *The accumulation of some fluid in his joints will decide the ratio at which his legs should open or close.* and who will decide how much of fluid should be accumulated? This will lead us to **[[localised Intelligence]]**. #Intelligence #emergence #Modularity

  + It is when a very abstract thing moves. It doesn't worry about how each molecule and each part will make fine adjustments. It moves and gets the feedback in that pure form ( removing the minute details).

  + This localised Intelligence is working for something bigger than itself. For example, when a spider walks, he feels let's step forward. Each of his legs will move automatically. The leg is working for something bigger, and the portion will wonder why I am doing this. "What is the bigger goal I have like this?"

  + I think when we say, god. We are talking about the same. We are talking about for which we are moving.
