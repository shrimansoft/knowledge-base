The concept of Information processing system( IOP)  I read in the book [Superrecursive algorithms]({{< ref "/pages/Superrecursive algorithms" >}}).

**Def:** Something that process information, I will have input, output and Processing unit. Although in the book they assumed the [[triadic structure of IPS]]. While in my writing I don't always assume that.

While I am working on the equality between action (output) and observation (input), sticking on the triad structure of IPS can lead to Inadequate results. #[[action = observation]]

We are also a information processing system. Wait and feel how it feel to be and Information processing system. Who it feels to be?

What is the meaning of this in the language of [[Process and Reality]] ?
