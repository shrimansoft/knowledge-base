## Thought


  + The complexity of the system increases when we go from atoms to Organism.

  + We can understand And Realise Some of the above structures of the system to predict what will happen to the system. #sub representation #randomness

  + That is good, but why is there modularity in nature itself?

  + what is the reasion? why does one world want to control another world 
background-color:: red
why why?

  + We can say something exists that's why it exists.
background-color:: blue

  + To exist, the world wants control over another world !!

  + To exist, do we want control over the other world?

  + why does the world need control over other world to exist?
background-color:: red

    + is there something more fundamental we need from another world?
background-color:: red

  + REMARK: abstract things don't exist on their own. Some abstract concepts exist with time. 
so, this abstract idea needs control over another world to get something.

  + REMARK: but thinking that this is our word, and there is some other world that is the choice we have in our world. So that everything may be one.

  + There is no separation at all

  + FUCK

  + where is this going? Is this entire game just the fuck of mind to make us exist and fuck.

  + This thought may not take us anywhere; it will just give us the chance to fuck. But there is no fundamental truth to explore at all

## Modularity **forced by the User.**


  + I read some papers on modularity. Then I realised the following things:
cite:: cluneEvolutionaryOriginsModularity2013

    + **We divide a complex system into small modules to understand it better.**

    + **There is no reason why a complex system to be modular on its own.** We usually make it modular so that we can understand it better.

    + ### **Emergence of simplicity.** 
todo:: hello

When a learning system uses other learning systems to solve some task, if the second learning system is too complicated for the first one to understand, Then the first one will not use it. But if a second learning system is easy to understand, the first one will use it. #World view

**In other words, we can see that the higher level of learning system forces the lower levels of learning systems to be modular in a hierarchical system.** (Maybe it's possible on a non-hierarchical learning system structure).

## Relation of modularity from **continuty**


  + An agent can have a modular solution if the task is modular.

  + We represent the task through the reward function.

  + It means we can break the reward function into a sub-reward function.

## **Spliting a function** and modularity.


  + Let us have a function.

  + $$ f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow R^m $$

  + we can write it as 
  $$ f_i : R^n \rightarrow R \textbf{ where  } i \in {1,..,m} $$

  + 
> If you are trying to tarin a function approximator to clone the function $f$. 
There are two possible causes: 
**Case1:**  $\forall  i$, $f_i$ is independent, then whether we train this function independently or together doesn't matter. 
**Case2:** if the parameters depend on each other, we have to train them together to get more efficiency.

    + There is a picture, and a good explanation of this is given in a photo.  Add the photo here

  + Experimental verification of the above hypothesis: generate the data from a well-defined function $F:\mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$. Then we train a neural network to mimic it. Yes, we can do that, but we will first train it to predict the $F_i$ individually and computer it by teaching the hole function.

  + We will make some modular structures in the $F$ and see the above comparation.

    + What is that modular structure


    + 

## Modularity and **evolvability**

  + ‚ÄúA major contributor to evolvability is the fact that many biological entities are modular‚Äù [^1]

  + ‚ÄúModularly varying goals seem to push populations away from local fitness maxima and guide them toward evolvable and modular solutions.‚Äù[^1]
