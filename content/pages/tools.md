New definition of tools

![image.png](/assets/image_1679671271593_0.png)

**Def:** tools is something which modifies the action or observation.

**Why we need** the Idea of tools.

  + It is the generalisation of the Reward function and value function.

  + It helps us to look at [Transfer flexibility]({{< ref "/pages/Transfer flexibility" >}}) from a new angle.

  + It's a step toward **Modularity of Agent**.

  + It also helps us to exploit the idea of localised Intelligence.
Howsince some of the tolls have their local intelligence. (Ex. The leg of a spider is a tool that the spider's body uses. The legs themselves hand some of the things. That is the thing body doesn't have to be wary about)

  + This Idea is very important for [Policy melting into the world]({{< ref "/pages/Policy melting into the world" >}}).



Why we are interested on this ?

  + Because it can make the following problems look like in a single framework.

    + Modularity ( Modularity is perplexing so need a good insight on this )

      + [Transfer flexibility]({{< ref "/pages/Transfer flexibility" >}})

    + Multiagent interaction. Where the agents are different. ( this will be achieved through Our new [World view]({{< ref "/pages/World view" >}}) )

    + MARL and MERL. ( I need to say how )

    + Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning and Multi-environment reinforcement Learning.. ( I need to say how )
