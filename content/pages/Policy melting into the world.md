Let's assume that we have a solution for [Diverse perceptron Nerual Network from Tools in RL.]({{< ref "/pages/Diverse perceptron Nerual Network from Tools in RL." >}}) , i.e., we have an Agent that can play chess by using this machine. We can see that machine $M$ is the part of Agent Which is outside in the world of the machine, which is the part of the world now it is inside Agent (part of agent).

( The agent I am talking about Is model-based ) since M is outside, we reflect M in Agent's model.

Similarly, we can make an agent (AGI) solve multiple problems using the same idea where the agent is learning to solve problems using  $M_1 M_2 â€¦.$ Machines.

List of problems can be solved through Melting Policy into the world
