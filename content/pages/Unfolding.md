What I mean when I say unfolding. It's like something was folded before, and now we are unfolding it. So, what do we mean? I like to talk about this thing with examples of this unfolding.

  + **Example 1** DNA $\to$ organism.

  + **Example 2** Everything in  this nature is unfolding. Time is it self a manifestation of this unfolding.

  + **Example 3** future $\to$ present $\to$ past   ( this is coming from Process and Reality ) #[Circle of time]({{< ref "/pages/Circle of time" >}})



I think above me have given some nice examples of what is unfolding. but the important question here is that *what is the inverse of this pronomina?*
  + I am not saying that Organism will become DNA. or the Past will become future. What I am saying is this how do DNA evolves? how do the future get manifested in our mind before it unfolded through action?

  + In neural network we use back propagation.  which is similar to the reviser of unfolding.

  + 

## Open question:

What is the inverse of the concept of unfolding? How do we understand the process by which the future becomes manifested in our minds before it has been acted upon?
