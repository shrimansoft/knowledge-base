  + [[back propagation]] How it gets folded before.

The word *unfolding* doesn't have the usual meaning in this context. Instead, it's the generalisation using the whitehead's [flight analogy](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3224137-the-true-method-of-discovery-is-like-the-flight-of).

First, we have to collect some examples before we take off from the imaginative generalisation.

**Example 1** Seed $\to$ organism.

**Example 2** IMAGINATION OF An art $\to$  REALIZATION OF IT as painting.

**Example 3** plan $\to$ Execution.

The example above will make the *unfolding* more apparent.

{{< logseq/mark >}}It's like something was folded before, and now it's unfolding.{{< / logseq/mark >}}

**Example 2** Everything in  this nature is unfolding. [[Time]] is it self a manifestation of this unfolding.

  + **Example 3** future $\to$ present $\to$ past   ( this is coming from [[Process and Reality]]. Not sure !! ) #[Circle of time]({{< ref "/pages/Circle of time" >}})



More profound meditation is needed for the question :What is the inverse of unfolding?
  + I am not saying that Organism will become DNA. or the Past will become future. What I am saying is this how do DNA evolves? how do the future get manifested in our mind before it unfolded through action?

  + In neural network we use [[back propagation]].  which is similar to the reviser of unfolding.

  + 

## Open question:

What is the inverse of the concept of unfolding? How do we understand the process by which the future becomes manifested in our minds before it has been acted upon?
