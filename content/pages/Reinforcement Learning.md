Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, is a type of machine learning that involves an agent learning from its environment through trial and error. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments for its actions, and over time, it learns to choose actions that maximize its reward.
**Supervised Learning:** Learning with labels defined by human
**Unsupervised Learning:** finding patterns in data. 
**Reinforcement Learning:** This is a $4^{rd}$ machine learning paradigm, in which agent tries to maximise its reward signal. through agent <-> world interaction.
