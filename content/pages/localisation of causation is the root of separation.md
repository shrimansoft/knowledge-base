What I experience is that the thing we see separately is only based on the fact that stuff near can affect each other, and things that are fare away can't affect each other.

We say I am acting on $A$ and not in $B$ because they are separated by space or time. Say I acted on this today, and I acted on that tomorrow.

Somehow all these things I think are head to answer are coming and connecting each other and I don't know form where should I start.
