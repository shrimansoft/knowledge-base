I remember a conversation with [Ashoke Sen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoke_Sen); I told him that in quantum entanglement, things are connected through distance, which looks counterintuitive when we look at it through the lens of the separation-based on spatial("related to space"). Maybe the idea of separation we are doing is not right in the first place. Perhaps the thing we are thinking are separate are not really separate. We can say that because we have to deal with the uncertainty of the system. We don't know how it's coming into the picture.
With this, we opened the entire new page of mystery that physicists have been working on for a long time: the "how do entanglement works."
Science is not everything, but this is what we have right now. How much do I say I am not a scientist anymore? I will be working under it becouse I don't have anything more than this ("scientific method of investigation").
