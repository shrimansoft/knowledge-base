Why do Nature follow some law ( constraints) and why something are random ( free at least from the Ability of our thought)?\nRandomness $\\to$ Evolution $\\to$ RL I was wondering from where this randomness comes. If we understand from where this randomness comes, we will know the source of the origin of Evolution. We will get the origin of learning in RL. What is randomness? It is the uncertainty, its lack of knowledge, the lack of predictability. If we put a cat in a room and the room if locked that the cat can’t scape it. Then we know that the cat will be in side the room but we don’t know where in the room this cat is. We don’t know exactly but we know partially where will it be.\nI don’t know what randomness is exactly but we can say that it’s the lack of knowledge.\nFree will $\\to$ Randomness We can even ask the question do we have free will since We are not the exception to this nature we are an example of it.\nSo if we have free will the structure which is trying to predict my behaviour will not be able to do this and conclude that there is some randomness in my behaviour.\nThings will be much more interesting if we replace me with the electron. We say that electron moves randomly but we can say similarly that electrons have free will.\nFree will comes with some constraints we can do some things and we can’t do some things. I can’t cross a wall but I can come close to it.\nI can’t kiss you but I can come close to you so that you can kiss me.\nProof of Randomness I just had a conversation with Dogara sir. In the last movement, we talked about randomness and do probably exists. but now I get the idea. Does probability exist or does randomness exist?\nbut before answering this let’s ask what is ranmoness?\nrandomness is an experience that an agent feels and why does the agent feel this randomness? because of the lack of knowledge. i.e. something you feel is random because you are not able to predict what will happen about that thing. So the randomness is the reflection of the lack of predictability.\nAlright,\nNow what do we mean by predictability and how do we predict something? Predictability boils down to simulation or copying i.e. if you want to predict a system. what you do you make a representation of in your mind. and try to run the model ( which is a representation of the original system.) that is in your mind faster than the original system itself. if you can achieve that it means that you can what will happen to that system because what you did is first you copied that system in your mind and ran that faster the the original system.\nOkay, now we are going to enter the world of Turing machines. i.e. in the world of recursive algorithms. suppose there is a very powerful computer and the ability of the computation is near close to the physical limit. you can’t compute anything faster than that. these computers are extremely fast and you can’t do anything better than that (anyway this is an assumption but a sensible one.)\nin that universe, some program is running and there is another program. lets name the first program $A$ and the second program $E$. where $A$ is representing the agent and $E$ is representing the enviroment.\nhere the program $A$ is trying to predict the behaviour of program $E$. alos remember that both of them are running on the same computer of say same computation speed.\nbut they are independent i.e. they are not using the same processing unit but $A$ can physically observe $E$.\nWhat program $A$ can do? what best it can do? it copies the entire algorithm of the program $E$ and runs it on its side. since we are already using the best physically possible computation power. we can do anything better than this.\nso if the program $A$ has the algorithm of program $E$. $A$ can’t run it faster the the original program. and if it can’t run it faster than the original program there is no meaning or predictability.\nso will alternative the program $A$ can do is make a simple representation of program $E$ ( need to work on how this representation will work. ) but suppose he gets some simple representation of the program $E$ then $A$ can run is representation faster then the program $E$ can predict some partial aspect of the $E$.\nBut since he is not working with the exact algorithm of $E$ intended he is working with is simple representation which is easy to compute. that will lead to the experience of randomness when program $A$ will deal with the program $E$.\nsub-representation Randomeness and Priditablity You are interested in the relationship between randomness and predictability in nature. You assume that there is some fundamental limit to how fast something can evolve, process, compute, or transmit information in nature. You also assume that the only way to predict something accurately is to make an exact simulation of it and run it faster than the original system. However, since this is impossible due to the fundamental limit, you suggest that the workaround is to make a simplified model of the original system with lower computational cost, so that you can run it faster than the original system. However, this also means that you cannot capture all the details and complexities of the original system, and therefore there will always be some randomness or uncertainty in your prediction, because your model is only an approximation of the original system. Some related works that you might find interesting are:\nRandomness and Predictability in Dynamic Chaos, a book chapter by A. A. Makarov that discusses how to measure the degree of determinability of a system using correlation coefficients between observed and modeled processes.\nRandomness versus Determinism: Myths and Misconceptions, a paper by N. Gisin that argues that quantum physics shows that nature is fundamentally random and not deterministic, and that this does not contradict causality or free will.\nPredictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly’s Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?, a paper by E. N. Lorenz that explores the concept of sensitive dependence on initial conditions, also known as the butterfly effect, which implies that small uncertainties in the initial state of a system can lead to large differences in its future behavior.\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 14/09/2023 (1) Randomness and Predictability in Dynamic Chaos | SpringerLink. https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-74366-5_4.
