For example, there is a field of vision where you can see some things and canâ€™t see others. Sounds exist, but you canâ€™t see them. The field of eyesight includes all the things that you can see.</description></item><item><title>Solar System</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/solar-system/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/solar-system/</guid><description>Planet Average Distance from the Sun (million km) Radius (km) Number of Moons Revolution Period (days) Rotation Period (hours) Mercury 57.9 2,440 0 88 1,408 Venus 108.2 6,052 0 225 5,832 Earth 149.6 6,371 1 365.25 24 Mars 227.9 3,389 2 687 24.6 Jupiter 778.5 69,911 79 4,333 9.9 Saturn 1.4 billion 58,232 83 10,747 10.7 Uranus 2.9 billion 25,362 27 30,589 17.2 Neptune 4.5 billion 24,622 14 59,800 16.</description></item><item><title>4 causes</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/4-causes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/4-causes/</guid><description>{{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdEzyA2HGnY}}

Future and Action The future is hope, dreams, expectations, and predictions, comes to the present through action. Thereâ€™s a catch though.
Suppose thereâ€™s something I predicted, like what I will do next. Maybe I predicted that I would leave the place or do something, and I achieved that future through my action.

and since the experience is dynamic in nature how can you cling to it.
so, you cling to the memory of those experience and the effort and force we appy to recreate those experience is worth less and not going to work.
our lack of wisdom make us do so.
and the frustatoin of not geting any result make us misarable.</description></item><item><title>communication</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/communication/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/communication/</guid><description>What is the difference between connection and communication?

By the Process and Reality &amp;ldquo;we are no exception to this nature we are example of it&amp;rdquo;. Taking this Idea we can say that everything is like us has some level of active participation in the nature and during this interaction these things are evolving too.
To make this some what abstract Idea that every thing are like us evolving.

Def: Something that process information, I will have input, output and Processing unit. Although in the book they assumed the triadic structure of IPS. While in my writing I don&amp;rsquo;t always assume that.
While I am working on the equality between action (output) and observation (input), sticking on the triad structure of IPS can lead to Inadequate results.</description></item><item><title>Local-global</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/local-global/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/local-global/</guid><description>Examples.

When we fix the policy, the above process becomes automatic. It will just run and run.
Because of a lack of knowledge, we use probability in this. #randomness
The above interaction dynamics can be studied using the MDP. So here, the MDP comes into the picture.
The MDP is how the agent sees his interaction with the world.</description></item><item><title>Memory</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/memory/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/memory/</guid><description>How do our brain stores the information? it stores its information not in the form it captured it but in the form in which is the most useful for the future.
Data Storage #Memory

In Space: we can do both direction communication .
But in Time we can only do one direction communication.
I was listening to an audiobook (1984 by George Orwell). In that book, The character wanted to write a letter. but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have anyone to send this letter,
To whom I am going to write this latter. My Future.
but he wondered how could he communicate with his future.</description></item><item><title>persist</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/persist/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/persist/</guid><description>Something exist because it exist.

The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments for its actions, and over time, it learns to choose actions that maximize its reward. Supervised Learning: Learning with labels defined by human
Unsupervised Learning: Learning patterns in data.
Reinforcement Learning: This is a $3^{rd}$ machine learning paradigm, in which agent tries to maximise its reward signal.</description></item><item><title>The black swan</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/the-black-swan/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/the-black-swan/</guid><description>Black swan theory - Wikipedia

Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s the generalisation using the whitehead&amp;rsquo;s flight analogy.
First, we have to collect some examples before we take off from the imaginative generalisation.
Example 1 Seed $\to$ organism.
Example 2 IMAGINATION OF An art $\to$ REALIZATION OF IT as painting.
Example 3 plan $\to$ Execution.
The example above will make the unfolding more apparent.
It&amp;rsquo;s like something was folded before, and now it&amp;rsquo;s unfolding.</description></item><item><title>Universal approximation</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/universal-approximation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/universal-approximation/</guid><description>AÂ feedforward neural network (FNN)Â is anÂ artificial neural networkÂ wherein connections between the nodes doÂ notÂ form a cycle.

In addition to these two classes, bounded depth and bounded width case
Universal approximation + learning algorithm.
+ so I am reading a nice book nice chapter on universal approximation theorem the proof of the universal approximation theorem here at the beginning the author mentioned that the universal approximation theorem is good and cool thing but there are other things that has this capability of universal approximation for example the Boolean circuits but what is amazing about the neural network is that it comes with two things one is the universality the universality of its ability to approximate and the learning algorithm so this learning algorithm plus the universality makes it this neural network amazing</description></item><item><title>World view</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/world-view/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/world-view/</guid><description>This comes from the fact that we can think inside our head that is just like another world.

One is how it works if it is already there, and the other is how it can come into being from thin air.
I will try to answer the first one on the page of Triangular MDP, but to address the second question, we need to look at how humans get the idea of separation.
Triangular MDP is the simple realization of separation through RL.</description></item></channel></rss>
