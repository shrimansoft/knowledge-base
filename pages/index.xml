For example, there is a field of vision where you can see some things and can’t see others. Sounds exist, but you can’t see them. The field of eyesight includes all the things that you can see.</description></item><item><title>Solar System</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/solar-system/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/solar-system/</guid><description>Planet Average Distance from the Sun (million km) Radius (km) Number of Moons Revolution Period (days) Rotation Period (hours) Mercury 57.9 2,440 0 88 1,408 Venus 108.2 6,052 0 225 5,832 Earth 149.6 6,371 1 365.25 24 Mars 227.9 3,389 2 687 24.6 Jupiter 778.5 69,911 79 4,333 9.9 Saturn 1.4 billion 58,232 83 10,747 10.7 Uranus 2.9 billion 25,362 27 30,589 17.2 Neptune 4.5 billion 24,622 14 59,800 16.</description></item><item><title>4 causes</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/4-causes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/4-causes/</guid><description>{{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdEzyA2HGnY}}
Material Cause: The matter that makes up an object, like the chemical composition of an apple. Formal Cause: The unique form or structure that defines the object&amp;rsquo;s identity. Efficient Cause: The process or event that brings an object into existence, such as the growth of the apple tree. Final Cause: The ultimate purpose or potential of an object, like the apple&amp;rsquo;s potential to grow into an apple tree. 🌱 Potency and Actuality: Objects have potency (potential) and actuality (realized potential).</description></item><item><title>ability to use new tools</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/ability-to-use-new-tools/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/ability-to-use-new-tools/</guid><description>the concept is very clear by it name. there are some Information processing system which are good at using tools while some of them strugle to do so.

and since the experience is dynamic in nature how can you cling to it.
so, you cling to the memory of those experience and the effort and force we appy to recreate those experience is worth less and not going to work.
our lack of wisdom make us do so.
and the frustatoin of not geting any result make us misarable.</description></item><item><title>communication</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/communication/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/communication/</guid><description>What is the difference between connection and communication?
Connection shows that there is a possibility of information flow. Communication needs a Language (a protocol to communicate.)

By the Process and Reality &amp;ldquo;we are no exception to this nature we are example of it&amp;rdquo;. Taking this Idea we can say that everything is like us has some level of active participation in the nature and during this interaction these things are evolving too.
To make this some what abstract Idea that every thing are like us evolving. I like to generalise this Idea that there is an agent rather every thing is an agent.</description></item><item><title>Important ideas</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/important-ideas/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/important-ideas/</guid><description>Reinforcement Learning

When we fix the policy, the above process becomes automatic. It will just run and run.
Because of a lack of knowledge, we use probability in this. #randomness
The above interaction dynamics can be studied using the MDP. So here, the MDP comes into the picture.
The MDP is how the agent sees his interaction with the world.</description></item><item><title>Memory</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/memory/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/memory/</guid><description>How do our brain stores the information? it stores its information not in the form it captured it but in the form in which is the most useful for the future.
Data Storage #Memory
I am in search of general Database management system.
This should Coherent with the World view.
It will be just like a world i.e. it will have a input and output.
Do it need a language?

We can understand And Realise Some of the above structures of the system to predict what will going happen to the system. #sub-representation #randomness
That is good, but why is there modularity in nature itself?
what is the reason? why does one world want to control another world why why?
We can say something exists that&amp;rsquo;s why it exists.</description></item><item><title>One direction Communication</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/one-direction-communication/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/one-direction-communication/</guid><description>File storage : communication from past to future. #Memory
In Space: we can do both direction communication .
But in Time we can only do one direction communication.
I was listening to an audiobook (1984 by George Orwell). In that book, The character wanted to write a letter. but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have anyone to send this letter,
To whom I am going to write this latter. My Future.
but he wondered how could he communicate with his future.</description></item><item><title>persist</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/persist/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/persist/</guid><description>Something exist because it exist.

Why do Nature follow some law ( constraints) and why something are random ( free at least from the Ability of our thought)?
Randomness $\to$ Evolution $\to$ RL I was wondering from where this randomness comes. If we understand from where this randomness comes, we will know the source of the origin of Evolution. We will get the origin of learning in RL.</description></item><item><title>Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/reinforcement-learning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/reinforcement-learning/</guid><description>Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, is a type of machine learning that involves an agent learning from its environment through trial and error. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments for its actions, and over time, it learns to choose actions that maximize its reward. Supervised Learning: Learning with labels defined by human Unsupervised Learning: finding patterns in data. Reinforcement Learning: This is a $4^{rd}$ machine learning paradigm, in which agent tries to maximise its reward signal.</description></item><item><title>Unfolding</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/unfolding/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/unfolding/</guid><description>The word unfolding doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the usual meaning in this context. Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s the generalisation using the whitehead&amp;rsquo;s flight analogy.
First, we have to collect some examples before we take off from the imaginative generalisation.
Example 1 Seed $\to$ organism.
Example 2 IMAGINATION OF An art $\to$ REALIZATION OF IT as painting.
Example 3 plan $\to$ Execution.
The example above will make the unfolding more apparent.
It&amp;rsquo;s like something was folded before, and now it&amp;rsquo;s unfolding.</description></item><item><title>Universal approximation</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/universal-approximation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/universal-approximation/</guid><description>A feedforward neural network (FNN) is an artificial neural network wherein connections between the nodes do not form a cycle.
Most universal approximation theorems can be parsed into two classes.
arbitrary width case arbitrary depth case
In addition to these two classes, bounded depth and bounded width case
Universal approximation + learning algorithm.
+ so I am reading a nice book nice chapter on universal approximation theorem the proof of the universal approximation theorem here at the beginning the author mentioned that the universal approximation theorem is good and cool thing but there are other things that has this capability of universal approximation for example the Boolean circuits but what is amazing about the neural network is that it comes with two things one is the universality the universality of its ability to approximate and the learning algorithm so this learning algorithm plus the universality makes it this neural network amazing</description></item><item><title>World view</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/world-view/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/world-view/</guid><description>This comes from the fact that we can think inside our head that is just like another world.
Important ideas Transfer flexibility/ability to use new tools. These two ideas were very similar.
Agent is doing something from his hand but now if I will give him some proper tool in his hand it is like changing the environment. Now learning to use the tool is similar to adopting to new environment.</description></item><item><title>Idea of separation</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/idea-of-separation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/idea-of-separation/</guid><description>There are two challenges we have with Triangular MDP. One is how it works if it is already there, and the other is how it can come into being from thin air.
I will try to answer the first one on the page of Triangular MDP, but to address the second question, we need to look at how humans get the idea of separation.
Triangular MDP is the simple realization of separation through RL.</description></item><item><title>Jul 21st, 2023</title><link>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/jul-21st-2023/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/jul-21st-2023/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
