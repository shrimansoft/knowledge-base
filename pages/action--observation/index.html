Future and Action The future is hope, dreams, expectations, and predictions, comes to the present through action. There’s a catch though.

Future, Action, and Observation #action = observation\nFuture and Action The future is hope, dreams, expectations, and predictions, comes to the present through action. There’s a catch though.\nSuppose there’s something I predicted, like what I will do next. Maybe I predicted that I would leave the place or do something, and I achieved that future through my action. But what if I predicted something over which I don’t have control? For instance, I predicted that a bud would become a flower. I don’t have control over that. It becomes a flower on its own. So, can I say it’s my action?\nMyopic look says, its not your action. but contrary it is also your action because you took the action of not cutting the flower, not killing the bird. You predicted that it would become flowers. In that sense, not harming the bird is an action that you took. It’s your choice.\nChoice, Some time we don’t even have a choice for example suppose you predict that tomorrow the sun will rise. assuming that you are one of use ordinary human you can’t do any thing. So, does we can say that the action is still yours? We still don’t have much reason to not say its not your action.\nWe can’t say that its out of your will even though its very visible. But what if you are and you choose not to show it similar to The black swan.\nFreewill There’s a problem though. There’s nothing called freewill. You are doing what you are supposed to do. I’m excited to write this because I’m looking for a precise answer.\nAction and Observation What is action and observation? There’s a future, there’s a past. The future comes to the present through action, and the present goes to the past through observation. What you observe will be in your past. What you haven’t observed is not in your pure past. Something you haven’t observed, what happened that day next to your room, you don’t know. That is not in your past.\nReinforcement Learning and World Structure Right now, this thing about action and observation is very interesting. I was doing this reinforcement learning thing, and then I came to this world structure. When I’m dealing with the world, I realize that action and observation are the same thing. It’s just the perspective that’s different.\nAction and Observation are the Same When I take action, everything is a world. You are another world. I am a world. This is a world. Action is like I take action on another world. Everything is a world. So someone takes action, it’s taking action on someone else. I take action, the other one will observe it. If I take action and when that person observes something, that person takes actions on me, I will observe something. If the wind will not hit me, I will not feel it. The wind is taking action on me, and I’m observing it.\nBut this pillar is taking action with some lights. But you know, what is action? When I start with some force. And what is observation? When I observe, I get some energy inside. Muscular. And if Lee knows converse, I think I practiced at the time.\n","wordCount":"552","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-12-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-02-26T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Shriman Keshri"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/pages/action--observation/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Shriman Keshri","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/favicon.ico"}}}</script><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-00000XXXXX"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),-gtag("config","G-00000XXXXX")</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://shrimansoft.github.io/knowledge-base/ accesskey=h title="Shriman Keshri (Alt + H)">Shriman Keshri</a>
